## 5-3. Alien Colors #1:
# Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. 
#   Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 
#       'green', 'yellow', or 'red'

# * Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green.
#        If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

alien_color = 'green'

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations! You earned 5 points!Pog")

# * Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another
#        that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

if alien_color == 'green':
    print("Congratulations! You earned 5 point!Pog")
if alien_color == 'yellow':
    print("Congratulations! You earned 69 point!Pog")
