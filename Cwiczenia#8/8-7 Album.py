## 8-7. Album:
# 
# Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary 
#   describing a music album. 
# 
# The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it 
#   should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of information. 
# 
# Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums. 
# 
# Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing 
#   the album information correctly.
# 
# Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you 
#   to store the number of songs on an album. 
# 
# If the calling line includes a value for the number of songs, 
#   add that value to the albumâ€™s dictionary. 
# 
# Make at least one new function call that includes the number 
#   of songs on an album.
